# 🌍 Environmental Impact of Food Production – Analysis & Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the **environmental footprint of food production** across greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water use. Using a dataset of 43 commonly consumed foods, the study examines sustainability from both macro and micro perspectives, identifying high-impact foods, critical lifecycle stages, and differences between plant-based and animal-based products.  

The goal is to generate **data-driven insights** to inform policies, consumer choices, and sustainable farming practices.

## 🎯 Goals
- Assess the **environmental impact** of food production.  
- Identify **hotspots** in lifecycle stages where emissions peak.  
- Compare **plant-based vs animal-based products**.  
- Rank foods from **most to least sustainable**.  
- Provide **recommendations** for reducing environmental impacts.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Size:** 43 records, 23 parameters  
- **Features include:**  
  - Greenhouse gas emissions per lifecycle stage  
  - Land use per kg of food  
  - Scarcity-weighted and freshwater water use  
  - Total emissions per food product  

### 🔧 Data Preparation
1. Standardized column names (snake_case).  
2. Filled null values using **median** (for skewed data) and **mean** (for normal distributions).  
3. Rounded float values to **2 decimal places**.  

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Questions
1. Which foods contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions, and at which stages?  
2. Which foods have the highest water footprint, and how does this correlate with carbon footprint?  
3. What is the relationship between food types and land use change emissions?  
4. At which stage of the food lifecycle do emissions peak for most products?  
5. Can foods be ranked from most to least sustainable based on emissions, land, and water use?  
6. How do animal-based products compare to plant-based products overall?

## 📊 Findings & Insights
- **Beef and lamb dominate environmental impact** with the highest emissions and land use change.  
- **Farm-stage activities** account for **over 80% of emissions**, making it the most critical intervention point.  
- **Cheese, nuts, and farmed fish** have high water footprints but lower emissions, showing **trade-offs across metrics**.  
- **Plant-based staples (cassava, bananas, root vegetables)** are the most sustainable foods.  
- **Animal-based foods have more than double the footprint** of plant-based foods, underscoring production inefficiencies.

## 🧠 Recommendations
1. **Promote plant-based diets** and support alternative proteins.  
2. **Reduce farm-level emissions** via precision agriculture, methane-reducing feed, and regenerative practices.  
3. **Target high-impact foods** (beef, lamb, dairy) for policy and consumer awareness interventions.  
4. **Encourage water-efficient farming** with modern irrigation and drought-resistant crops.  
5. **Protect and restore ecosystems** by limiting deforestation and investing in reforestation.  
6. **Support food system innovation** in sustainable farming and climate-smart livestock.  
7. **Raise consumer awareness** through sustainability labeling and education.
